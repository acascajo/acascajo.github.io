## About me
I received the PhD degree in Computer Science and Technology at the Carlos III University of Madrid in 2021. He completed a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Technology at the same university, being part of the ARCOS research group since 2013. 

Initially, my research was focused on the development of railway construction simulators. Since 2017, this research interest includes High Performance Computing (HPC), Quantum Computing (QC), Hybrid HPC-QC, code optimization, monitoring and scheduling at a node and application levels. I am the author of eight papers published in scientific journals, and more than twenty in national and international conferences. I have also participated in twenty different researching projects (including national and international) and have been IP in one internal researching project at UC3M.


## Work Experience

### Post-Doctoral Researcher, University Carlos III of Madrid
*Feb 2022 - Present*

- Computational epidemiology 
- High-Performance Computing
- Dynamic Resource Management features on HPC platforms
- Monitoring large-scale platform
- Developing railway simulators in cooperation with a specialized company
- Edge computing

### Associate Professor, University Carlos III of Madrid
*July 2016 - present*

- Computer Architecture: The main objective of this course is to know the basic concepts about the architecture of a computer and its impact on the performance of applications and computer systems. In its practical part, this knowledge should be applied using lock-free programming (lower-level parallelism). The language used is C/C ++.

- Operating Systems: The main objective of this subject is to know the function of the operating system as an extended machine, the services it oﬀers to the rest of the system, and its main components and entities (processes, memory, files, etc.), the concepts of concurrency, and the relationships of the operating system with the rest of the computer software and hardware. We focus on understanding the functionality that the operating system includes and that the applications can use. In addition, we teach how task schedulers work, how programs interact and communicate with each other, and how the application threads work in concurrent programming. The language used is C.

- Computer Structure: The main objective of this subject is to understand basic concepts about the organization and structure of a computer, such as data representation, basic arithmetic, execution of instructions, assembly programming, main memory, cache and virtual memory, and I/O systems. The practical environment in this subject includes the RISC-V architecture for assembly programming and microprogramming (implementing the micro-code of the instructions).

### Software developer, University Carlos III of Madrid
*May 2013 - Aug 2017*

- Software developer in diﬀerent languages for different applications (C/C++, C#, Python, Shelscripts).
- Development and maintenance of simulation software for companies (C#).
